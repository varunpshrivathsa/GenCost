Your system now behaves like an intelligent router:
it analyzes past telemetry, then dynamically decides where a new request should go.

ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ve Built

Stage 1 built the sensors (data + telemetry).
Stage 2 added the brain (reason + decide).

You now have a functioning autonomous FinOps reasoning loop â€” the foundation for adaptive learning.
